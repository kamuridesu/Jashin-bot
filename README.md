# PROJECT STATUS: ARCHIVED

~~Refer to https://github.com/kamuridesu/WhatsappBot to see new updates. While this project is stale, it has a simple fix which has to be implemented on the template: multi-device support. So use this instead of the original template while I rewrite the original.~~

# NEW BOT: https://github.com/kamuridesu/Riko-WABot

I have written a simple bot based of this one to test a brand new blazingly fast jamvamscrimpt framework! Check it on https://github.com/kamuridesu/Riko-WABot

The framework can be found on https://github.com/kamuridesu/WhatFramework!
